# Coditation Assignment #

This assignment is build using java. In this assignment the user inserts the dimension of the matrix. 
After that user inserts into the matrix 0's and 1's, 0 is defines the cell is DEAD, while 1 defines
the cell is still ALIVE. The operational functions are divided into 4 categories:

1) To display the matrix as it is before performing operation.
2) To display the matrix after performining operation on it.
3) Providing the number of cell .i.e from 0 to N elements for searching the status of cell whether 
   its DEAD or ALIVE.
4) To display the Matrix in the form of Graph.



Steps/Working of the program:

Step 1: Copy the file in the present working directory and launch the Command Line Interface of same path.

Step 2: Compile the program by using Javac .i.e "Javac Coditation.java".

Step 3: Run the program using Java .i.e "Java Coditation". It will run the program sucessfully.

Step 4: Insert the X co-ordinate and Y co-ordinate of matrix .i.e the Row and Column of Matrix and hit Enter.
	Enter X dimension:
	2
	Enter Y dimension:
	2

Step 5: Insert the elements in to the matrix .i.e 0's and 1's. 0 for cell DEAD and 1 for cell ALIVE.
	1
	1
	1
	1

Step 6: It will display 3 functional operations options:
	1. Display the matrix before solving.
	2. Display the matrix after solving.
	3. Search the status of the cell  by passing cell number.

Step 7: By clicking 1st option it will display the matrix without carrying any operation on it.
	Before solving:
	1 1
	1 1

	By clicking 2nd option it will perform the operation and the conditions for expected results.
	After Solving:
	0 0
	0 0

Step 8: By clicking 3rd option it will search for an desired cell number from 1 to N elements and It will display
	the number of elements present in the matrix.

	Matrix has 4 elements.
	Enter the number of cell to check status:
	3

	Cell no 3 is DEAD.

	As the cell number contains the value 0 so it displays the cell is DEAD else it will print Cell is ALIVE.

Step 9: By clicking on 4th option it displays the graph which shows which all cells are DEAD and ALIVE.

Step 10: After the operations done providing any unusual number except the options will terminate the program.
